Let's prove it gets hotter near the equator...

## WeatherPy

Assists in visualizing >500 cities across the world using randomly generated coordinates across the globe. This data is then paired with the closest city with a population >500 using the [citipy Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy). Utilized the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to gather current weather data for the date the information is run.

Data files and figures are saved in the Output-Data file.

### Output-Data

- Contains the following:
    - csv file of randomly generated cities across the world
    - figures of the world comparing latitude to temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed
    - figures of the northern and southern hemispheres each comparing latitude to temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed with linear regression lines
    - figure of the data set latitude vs. longitude
